SimpleELN is an integrated management system that oversees diverse data records, their classification and tagging, as well as collaborative sharing. Each discrete dataset with a relatively focused objective can be classified as a **Notebook**, and SimpleELN serves as the management system for various independent notebooks. Within this system, each individual notebook is designated as a **project** with unique identifiers and attributes.
