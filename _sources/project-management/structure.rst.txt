In SimpleELN, dataset with a relatively focused objective can be classified as a **Notebook** and designated as a **Project** with unique identifiers and attributes. Each project encompasses non-modifiable experimental data and modifiable annotation data as per requirements, presenting a structured approach to organizing experimental data and annotations. This facilitates collaboration and sharing among researchers, ensures data integrity and traceability, and provides efficient search capabilities.
