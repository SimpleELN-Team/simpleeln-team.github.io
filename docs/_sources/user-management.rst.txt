**SimpleELN** can be installed either as a desktop application (**Personal Edition**) or as a web server accessible via a browser (**Personal Edition**, **Team Edition** and **MultiTeam Edition**). Upon first accessing the application, you will automatically be redirected to the account initialization page, where a user account with full management privileges will be created. Once this valid user account is initialized, additional user accounts can be created and managed as needed subsequently.
